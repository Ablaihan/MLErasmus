===== Learning outcomes =====

!bblock
The course introduces a variety of central algorithms and methods essential for studies of data analysis and machine learning. The course is project based and through the various projects, normally three, you will be exposed to fundamental research problems in these fields, with the aim to reproduce state of the art scientific results. You will learn to develop and structure large codes for studying these systems, get acquainted with computing facilities and learn to handle large scientific projects. A good scientific and ethical conduct is emphasized throughout the course. More specifically, after this course you will

* Learn about basic data analysis, Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods, data optimization and machine learning;
* Be capable of extending the acquired knowledge to other systems and cases;
* Have an understanding of central algorithms used in data analysis and machine learning;
* Gain knowledge of central aspects of Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, Gibbs samplers and their possible applications;
* Understand linear methods for regression and classification;
* Learn about neural network, genetic algorithms and Boltzmann machines;
* Work on numerical projects to illustrate the theory. The projects play a central role and you are expected to know modern programming languages like Python or C++.

===== Teaching and projects =====
!bblock

The course will be taught as an intensive  course of duration of three weeks, with a
total time of 45 h of lectures, 45 h of exercises and  a final assignment of 2 weeks of work for those of you who  wish to receive 7 ECTS credits for the course. 
The total load, with the additional project to be handed in later,  will be approximately 160-170 hours, corresponding to  _7 ECTS_ in Europe.


The final assignment will be graded
with marks A, B, C, D, E and failed for Master students and passed/not passed for PhD students.

A course certificate will be issued for students requiring it from the University of Trento. This certificate states that you have completed the equivalent of 7 ECTS at the graduate level. We plan also to issue a certificate for those of you who have attended the course but did not want to do the final project. This certificate will most likely correspond to 4 ECTS at the graduate level. 

The organization of a typical course day is as follows:

|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Time  |  Activity                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 930am1230pm| Lectures, project relevant information and directed exercises|
| 1230pm-230pm| Lunch                                       |
| 230pm-6pm |  Computational projects, exercises  and hands-on sessions    |
| 6pm-7pm |  Wrap-up of the day and eventual student presentations       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|

===== Audience and Prerequisites =====
!bblock

You are expected to have operating programming skills in in
compiled programming languages like Fortran or C++ or alternatively an
interpreted language like Python and knowledge of quantum mechanics at
an intermediate level.  Preparatory modules on second quantization,
Wick's theorem, representation of Hamiltonians and calculations of
Hamiltonian matrix elements, independent particle models and
Hartree-Fock theory are provided at the website of the course.
Students who have not studied the above topics are expected to gain
this knowledge prior to attendance.  Additional modules for
self-teaching on Fortran and/or C++ or Python are also provided.
