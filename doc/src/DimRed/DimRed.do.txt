===== Reducing the number of degrees of freedom, overarching view  =====
!bblock

Many Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of features for each training
instance. Not only does this make training extremely slow, it can also make it much harder to find a good
solution, as we will see. This problem is often referred to as the curse of dimensionality.
Fortunately, in real-world problems, it is often possible to reduce the number of features considerably,
turning an intractable problem into a tractable one.

Here we will discuss some of the most popular dimensionality
reduction techniques: the principal component analysis PCA, Kernel PCA, and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE).

===== Principal Component Analysis =====
!bblock
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm.
First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data, and then it projects the data onto it.

The following Python code uses NumPy’s _svd()_ function to obtain all the principal components of the
training set, then extracts the first two principal components
!bc pycod
X_centered = X - X.mean(axis=0)
U, s, V = np.linalg.svd(X_centered)
c1 = V.T[:, 0]
c2 = V.T[:, 1]
!ec

PCA assumes that the dataset is centered around the origin. Scikit-Learn’s PCA classes take care of centering
the data for you. However, if you implement PCA yourself (as in the preceding example), or if you use other libraries, don’t
forget to center the data first.

Once you have identified all the principal components, you can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset
down to $d$ dimensions by projecting it onto the hyperplane defined by the first $d$ principal components.
Selecting this hyperplane ensures that the projection will preserve as much variance as possible. 
!bc pycod
W2 = V.T[:, :2]
X2D = X_centered.dot(W2)
!ec

!split 
===== PCA and scikit-learn =====

Scikit-Learn’s PCA class implements PCA using SVD decomposition just like we did before. The
following code applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset down to two dimensions (note
that it automatically takes care of centering the data):
!bc pycod
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components = 2)
X2D = pca.fit_transform(X)
!ec
After fitting the PCA transformer to the dataset, you can access the principal components using the
components variable (note that it contains the PCs as horizontal vectors, so, for example, the first
principal component is equal to 
!bc pycod
pca.components_.T[:, 0]).
!ec
Another very useful piece of information is the explained variance ratio of each principal component,
available via the $explained\_variance\_ratio$ variable. It indicates the proportion of the dataset’s
variance that lies along the axis of each principal component. 
More material to come here.

===== More on the PCA =====
Instead of arbitrarily choosing the number of dimensions to reduce down to, it is generally preferable to
choose the number of dimensions that add up to a sufficiently large portion of the variance (e.g., 95%).
Unless, of course, you are reducing dimensionality for data visualization — in that case you will
generally want to reduce the dimensionality down to 2 or 3.
The following code computes PCA without reducing dimensionality, then computes the minimum number
of dimensions required to preserve 95% of the training set’s variance:
!bc pycod
pca = PCA()
pca.fit(X)
cumsum = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
d = np.argmax(cumsum >= 0.95) + 1
!ec
You could then set $n\_components=d$ and run PCA again. However, there is a much better option: instead
of specifying the number of principal components you want to preserve, you can set $n\_components$ to be
a float between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating the ratio of variance you wish to preserve:
!bc pycod
pca = PCA(n_components=0.95)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)
!ec

!split
===== Incremental PCA =====
One problem with the preceding implementation of PCA is that it requires the whole training set to fit in
memory in order for the SVD algorithm to run. Fortunately, Incremental PCA (IPCA) algorithms have
been developed: you can split the training set into mini-batches and feed an IPCA algorithm one minibatch
at a time. This is useful for large training sets, and also to apply PCA online (i.e., on the fly, as new
instances arrive).

!split
===== Randomized PCA =====

Scikit-Learn offers yet another option to perform PCA, called Randomized PCA. This is a stochastic
algorithm that quickly finds an approximation of the first d principal components. Its computational
complexity is $O(m \times d^2)+O(d^3)$, instead of $O(m \times n^2) + O(n^3)$, so it is dramatically faster than the
previous algorithms when $d$ is much smaller than $n$.

!split
===== Kernel PCA =====
!bblock

The kernel trick is a mathematical technique that implicitly maps instances into a
very high-dimensional space (called the feature space), enabling nonlinear classification and regression
with Support Vector Machines. Recall that a linear decision boundary in the high-dimensional feature
space corresponds to a complex nonlinear decision boundary in the original space.
It turns out that the same trick can be applied to PCA, making it possible to perform complex nonlinear
projections for dimensionality reduction. This is called Kernel PCA (kPCA). It is often good at
preserving clusters of instances after projection, or sometimes even unrolling datasets that lie close to a
twisted manifold.
For example, the following code uses Scikit-Learn’s KernelPCA class to perform kPCA with an
!bc pycod
from sklearn.decomposition import KernelPCA
rbf_pca = KernelPCA(n_components = 2, kernel="rbf", gamma=0.04)
X_reduced = rbf_pca.fit_transform(X)
!ec

!split
===== LLE =====

Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is another very powerful nonlinear dimensionality reduction
(NLDR) technique. It is a Manifold Learning technique that does not rely on projections like the previous
algorithms. In a nutshell, LLE works by first measuring how each training instance linearly relates to its
closest neighbors (c.n.), and then looking for a low-dimensional representation of the training set where
these local relationships are best preserved (more details shortly). 



!split
=====  Other techniques =====


There are many other dimensionality reduction techniques, several of which are available in Scikit-Learn.

Here are some of the most popular:
* _Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)_ reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the distances between the instances.
* _Isomap_ creates a graph by connecting each instance to its nearest neighbors, then reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the geodesic distances between the instances.
* _t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding_ (t-SNE) reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. It is mostly used for visualization, in particular to visualize clusters of instances in high-dimensional space (e.g., to visualize the MNIST images in 2D).
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is actually a classification algorithm, but during training it learns the most discriminative axes between the classes, and these axes can then be used to define a hyperplane onto which to project the data. The benefit is that the projection will keep classes as far apart as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionality before running another classification algorithm such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier discussed in the SVM lectures.
